## **Overview**
Our film analysis project is a data-driven project that aims to uncover the key factors contributing to the financial success and popularity of movies in the cinematography industry.  This analysis project benefits from an extensive dataset comprising a staggering 146,000 films. This rich and diverse data was sourced meticulously from prominent film industry databases, including Box Office Mojo, Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Rotten Tomatoes, The Movie Database (TMDB), and The Numbers Movie Budget. By leveraging this comprehensive dataset, our project aims to gain valuable insights and provide data-driven recommendations to guide decision-making processes and optimize the success of movies in the ever-evolving and competitive film landscape.

## **Business Problem**
In the history of the cinematography industry, remarkable movies such as 'Avatar' (2009), 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019), 'Titanic' (1997), among others, have achieved tremendous success, captivating global audiences and redefining filmmaking. However, in the last years and amplified by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has faced significant disruptions due to the surge in popular streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Tubi (which is free), Hulu, and others. As a result, producing a movie that attracts audiences to cinemas has become more challenging than ever before. Creating a successful film today requires unprecedented rigor and adaptation to the changing landscape of movie consumption.

For this project, we meticulously collected and cleaned comprehensive data from five prominent databases within the film industry: [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and [The Numbers Movie Budget](https://www.the-numbers.com/). From Box Office Mojo, we extracted valuable information on 3,387 movies released between 2010 and 2018, encompassing details such as title, studio, domestic gross, foreign gross, and year of release. IMDB proved to be an invaluable resource, supplying an extensive dataset covering over 146,000 movies with attributes like title, duration, rating, actors, directors, and writers. The Movie Database (TMDB) enriched our analysis with additional movie-related metadata, including posters, release dates, plot summaries, and production details. The Numbers Movie Budget contributed essential financial insights, including production budgets, domestic box office earnings, and worldwide box office earnings.
In order to ensure consistency and comparability, we carefully filtered and curated the data to create a sample of nearly 1500 films with the same set of variables we carefully filtered and curated the data to create a sample of nearly 1500 films with the same set of variables covering a window from 2010 to 2019. While we assessed data from all five sources, the primary data utilized in this project originated from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, and The Numbers Movie Budget. These datasets played a pivotal role in conducting a comprehensive analysis, encompassing both financial and qualitative aspects of the movies, resulting in meaningful conclusions and informed insights.


## Methods
In this project, a robust data processing approach was employed, which included eliminating rows with missing values to ensure data integrity. Additionally, numerical variables were standardized to achieve uniform scaling for unbiased analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib, providing valuable initial insights, exploring data distributions, and identifying patterns. Tableau Public was utilized for the final visualization, creating interactive and visually appealing representations of the results. Multiple ANOVA tests were conducted to assess the significance of differences between variables, enabling a comprehensive understanding of various factors' impacts. Moreover, linear regression was applied to explore relationships between variables and potential predictors. Through these multifaceted methodologies, a systematic and thorough analysis was conducted, leading to valuable insights and sound conclusions derived from the dataset.
