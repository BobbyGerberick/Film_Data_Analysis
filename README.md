## **Overview**

## **Business Problem**
In the history of the cinematography industry, remarkable movies such as 'Avatar' (2009), 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019), 'Titanic' (1997), among others, have achieved tremendous success, captivating global audiences and redefining filmmaking. However, in the last years and amplified by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has faced significant disruptions due to the surge in popular streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Tubi (which is free), Hulu, and others. As a result, producing a movie that attracts audiences to cinemas has become more challenging than ever before. Creating a successful film today requires unprecedented rigor and adaptation to the changing landscape of movie consumption.![image](https://github.com/pmjustafort/Film_Data_Analysis/assets/137816262/86e3aa17-29d6-4e40-8bc0-9fe1e1b3d1d3)
